# Features
* poll a physical sensor 
* generate an alert when wet

# File notes
* alert and clear sh files are stubs. replace them with your actions
* water.py is a sample sensor
* water2.py is just another sensor
* one copy of the program runs per sensor for now, I'm lazy
* modify the sensor_name because its what spews to screen
* a few jpg's to show a sample [display](display.jpg) and [sample sensor](sensor.jpg)
* start_sensors.sh can be called from rc.local to start a screen session on boot
* send_slack.py uses waterpi.yaml, copy to /etc and edit the webhook
